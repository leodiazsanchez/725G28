## Overview

This repository contains the work completed as part of the **725G28 Databases and Data Modelling** course at **Link√∂ping University**. The course focuses on the design, implementation, and usage of relational databases, with a particular emphasis on **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**. Key topics covered include:

- **Database design**: Principles of creating well-structured databases, including identifying entities, defining relationships, ensuring data integrity, and applying **normalization** techniques to eliminate redundancy and improve data efficiency.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**: Designing and implementing databases using ER diagrams, which represent the entities, attributes, and relationships within the system.
- **Database implementation**: Setting up and configuring MSSQL databases, defining tables, constraints, keys, and indexes to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
- **Database usage**: Practical usage of MSSQL for data manipulation, including performing CRUD operations and working with stored procedures and views.
